# Contributing to DreamCoder

Thank you for your interest in DreamCoder! Whether you're reporting a bug, suggesting a feature, or submitting code, all contributions are welcome.

## ⚡ 5-Minute Quick Start (TL;DR)

```bash
# 1. Fork on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/<your-name>/dreamcoder.git && cd dreamcoder

# 2. Install dependencies (Bun >= 1.0, Rust, Node >= 18 required)
bun install

# 3. Start the desktop app in dev mode
cd desktop && bun run dev

# 4. Pick an issue with the `good first issue` or `help wanted` label,
#    create a feature branch from `dev`
git checkout dev && git checkout -b feat/your-feature

# 5. Code → bun run lint → bun run test → push → open a PR targeting `dev`
```

👉 **First time?** Browse [good first issues](https://github.com/GoDiao/dreamcoder/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). Each one has a mentor — feel free to ping them in the issue or PR.

## Code of Conduct

- Respect every contributor.
- Keep discussions constructive; no personal attacks.
- If you discover a security vulnerability, please contact the maintainer privately instead of filing a public Issue.

## How to Contribute

### Report a Bug

1. Search [Issues](https://github.com/GoDiao/dreamcoder/issues) to see if it has already been reported.
2. If not, open a new Issue with:
   - **Environment**: OS version, DreamCoder version (Settings → About).
   - **Steps to reproduce**: Clearly describe the actions that trigger the bug.
   - **Expected vs actual behavior**.
   - **Screenshots or logs** (if available).

### Feature Request

1. Search existing Issues first to avoid duplicates.
2. Open a new Issue describing:
   - What problem you want to solve.
   - What the feature should look like.
   - Why it's valuable to you.

### Submit Code

1. **Fork the repo** and create a feature branch from `dev`:
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Develop**. Follow the project's code style:
   - TypeScript strict mode, avoid `any`.
   - React function components + Hooks.
   - Zustand for state management.
   - Tailwind CSS v4 for styling.

3. **Commit**. Use semantic commit messages:
   ```
   feat: add XXX feature
   fix: fix XXX issue
   refactor: refactor XXX
   docs: update XXX docs
   chore: miscellaneous changes
   ```

4. **Test**. Make sure your changes don't break existing functionality:
   ```bash
   cd desktop
   bun run lint    # TypeScript type checking
   bun run test    # run tests
   ```

5. **Submit a PR**. Target the `dev` branch. Describe what you changed and why.
